Why this name, Argus?
=====================

The library name is a reference to a planet from World of Warcraft.
Argus is the original homeworld of the eredar (a race of supremely talented magic-wielders), now located within the Twisting Nether.
It was once described as a utopian world whose inhabitants were both vastly intelligent and highly gifted in magic.
It has since been twisted by demonic, chaotic energies and became the stronghold and homeworld of the Burning Legion.
